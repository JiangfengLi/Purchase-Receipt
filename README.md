# Purchase-Receipt
In this project, a static website with one HTML file containing a &lt;style> and &lt;script> block (it will be pretty big) was built. The purpose of this webpage is to allow the user to 'buy' (okay, pretend to buy) something. What you are buying is up to you (don't 'sell' anything illegal). When you submit your form, replace the form with a receipt (shown after the purchase form).   The purchase form must have all name, phone. and address inputs. The options must be in a legend, and you must have a quantity number.  Otherwise, style away any way you want (BTW: the yellow input fields were auto-completed by Chrome, they started as the default white).
