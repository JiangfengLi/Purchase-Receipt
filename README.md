# Purchase-Receipt
In this project, a static website with one HTML file containing a &lt;style> and &lt;script> block (it will be pretty big) was built. The purpose of this webpage is to allow the user to 'buy' (okay, pretend to buy) something. What customers are buying is up to them (don't 'sell' anything illegal). When the customer submit your form, replace the form with a receipt (shown after the purchase form).   The purchase form must have all name, phone. and address inputs. The options must be in a legend, and you must have a quantity number.
